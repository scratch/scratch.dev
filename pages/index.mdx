Scratch compiles Markdown and React into beautiful static websites that can be hosted anywhere.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install scratch
curl -fsSL https://scratch.dev/install.sh | bash

# Create a new project
scratch create

# Start the dev server
scratch dev
```

## What can you do with Scratch?

Scratch lets you write in Markdown and embed interactive React components, like this counter:

<Counter />

Scratch was designed for collaborative writing with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code). Use your favorite editor to write in Markdown, and ask a coding agent for help when it's easier to express yourself with code.

You can use React components to <Fire>style text</Fire> or embed fully working demos in your product specs:

<TodoList />

Scratch uses [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), to render your prose with a clean aesthetic. Code blocks use syntax highlighting by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/).

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Scratch also supports Github-flavored Markdown features like checklists and tables:

| Feature | Supported? |
|---------|-----------|
| Compiles Markdown, TS, JS & CSS | ✅ |
| Dev server with HMR | ✅ |
| Tailwind CSS styling | ✅ |
| Code syntax highlighting | ✅ |

Unlike traditional word processors, Scratch makes it easy to express any idea. If you can describe it to a coding  agent, you can add it to your document:

```text
Make me a component that looks like a TV screen with a bouncing DVD logo. Count the number of times the logo hits a corner and display that below the TV.
```

<BouncingDvdLogo />

Collaborating with AI makes writing more fun. Scratch makes that easy.

## No Boilerplate

Scratch uses an opinionated project structure and requires **no boilerplate or configuration**: just create a project, run the dev server with `scratch dev`, and start writing.

A simple Scratch project (created with `scratch create`) looks like this:

<Files content={`
mysite/
.pages/
..index.mdx
..Counter.tsx
.public/ (collapsed)
..logo.png
..favicon.svg
`} />

Use `scratch build` to compile this project into a static website, like this one. You can change styles and customize the page wrapper component by modifying the files in the `src/` directory:

<Files content={`
mysite/
.pages/
.public/
.src/
..markdown/
..PageWrapper.tsx
..tailwind.css
.package.json
`} />

Component files and js/ts libraries can live anywhere in `pages/` and `src/`. They are auto-detected by Scratch and don't need to be explicitly imported in your .mdx files as long as the filename matches the component name.

Scratch installs build dependencies automatically. You can add additional third-party dependencies by including a `package.json` file in your project root.

## Built on Bun

Scratch is built on [Bun](https://bun.com/) for lightning-fast builds, development with HMR, and native typescript support. It uses the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework to make component styling easy. 

Scratch compiles Javascript (.js), Typescript (.ts), JSX (.jsx), TSX (.tsx), Markdown (.md), and MDX (.mdx).

## Commands

```bash
# Create a new project
scratch create [path]     # create project at path (default: current directory)

# Start dev server with hot module reloading
scratch dev

# Build for production
scratch build
scratch build --no-ssg        # disable static site generation
scratch build --development   # unminified, with source maps

# Preview production build locally
scratch preview

# Remove build artifacts
scratch clean

# Revert a file to its template version
scratch revert [file]           # revert a file to its template version
scratch revert --force [file]   # overwrite without confirmation
scratch revert --list           # list available template files

# Update scratch to latest version
scratch update
```
