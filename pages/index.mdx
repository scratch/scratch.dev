Scratch is a tool for writing with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [React](https://react.dev/).

Write in Markdown and embed React components right in your text. Scratch compiles your work into beautiful static websites (like [this one](https://github.com/scratch/scratch.dev)) that can be hosted anywhere.

Scratch was designed for collaborative writing with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code). Use your favorite editor to write in Markdown, and ask a coding agent for help when it's easier to express yourself with code.


## Quick Start

Scratch requires no configuration so it's easy to get started:

```bash
# Install scratch
curl -fsSL https://scratch.dev/install.sh | bash

# Create a new project
scratch create

# Start the dev server
scratch dev
```

Now you're ready to start writing in `pages/index.mdx`.

## What can you do with Scratch?

Scratch lets you embed interactive React components into your writing, like this counter:

<Counter />

You can use components to <Fire>style text</Fire> or embed fully working demos in your product specs:

<TodoList />

Scratch uses [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) to render your prose with a clean aesthetic. It supports [Github-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) out of the box. Code blocks use syntax highlighting by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/).

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Unlike traditional word processors, Scratch makes it easy to express any idea. If you can describe it to a coding  agent, you can add it to your document:

Collaborating with AI makes writing more fun. Scratch makes that easy.

[Bun](https://bun.com/) for lightning-fast builds, development with HMR, native typescript support, and a portable executable.

[React](https://react.dev/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) make it possible to write with Markdown and code. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes component styling easy.

Content preprocessing relies on [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/), with [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) for GitHub Flavored Markdown and [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) plus [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) for parsing front matter.

[Shiki](https://shiki.style/) provides beautiful, accurate syntax highlighting with VS Code's grammar engine.

[Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) scaffolds the CLI.
