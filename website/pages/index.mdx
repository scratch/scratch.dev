# scratch

scratch is a simple tool for vibe writing.

Use your favorite code editor to write in markdown.

If you want to add visual structure to your content, ask your favorite coding agent to build you a react component, like this:

<Highlight>

This is a component for highlighting text

</Highlight>

You can also add little apps to your content, like this:

<Counter />

</PageWrapper>
