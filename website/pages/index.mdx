# scratch

scratch is a tool for "vibe writing".

It's a static site generator that allows you to write in markdown and React. 

It's only a [few hundred lines of code](https://github.com/scratch/scratch), but when combined with an AI code editor like [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) it is more powerful and intuitive than any word processor.

Get started by running the following commands:

```
# install scratch
npm install -g @scratch-dev/scratch

# create a new project
scratch create my-project
```

Now, use your favorite code editor to write in markdown.

If you want to add visual structure to your content, ask your favorite coding agent to build you a react component, like this:

<Highlight>

This is a component for highlighting text

</Highlight>

You can also add little apps to your content, like this:

<Counter />

You can add anything you can think of--if it can be expressed in javascript, you can 


</PageWrapper>
